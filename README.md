# Machine_Learning_powered_Asteroids_Game
This is the famous asteroids and spaceship game built using HTML and JavaScript, where Machine Learning gives it a unique touch.

The asteroids and spaceship is a classic game which has been enjoyed for many years. I have built this game using HTML and 
JavaScript. The unique feature which I have added in this game is that I have automated the rotation of ship and shooting of lasers
with the help of Machine Learning.

With the implementation of neural network, I have trained the spaceship to rotate towards the closest asteroid and then shoot
accordingly.

The game can also be turned to manual control as per the user's wish. As a feature of game, it has different levels with each
increasing level, the difficulty also increases and the count of asteroids also increases with each increasing level.

The score is also stored locally of each game and along with this, player has three lives.
